As soon as I initialize a repository, git starts to keep track on my actions.

The value of the staging area is that multiple changes can be separated into different and thus
meaningful commits

I can use the staging area to only use one commit per logical change: Only stage one logical change,
commit it and then stage the second logical change, commit it and so on.

Branching helps me when experimenting or creating different versions which should not affect the 
master branch.

Diagrams help me to visualize the branch structure since they always tell me how different versions 
are related.
